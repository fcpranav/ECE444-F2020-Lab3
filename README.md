## Activity 3

Briefly summarize the difference between SQL or NoSQL database.

SQL databases follow a relational model while NoSQL databases follow a non-relational model. SQL databases are compact and avoid duplication with their use of tables and relationships. NoSQL databases have more duplication and are document-oriented or key-valued. NoSQL databases however can perform better than SQL databases.
