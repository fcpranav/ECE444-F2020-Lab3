# Docker vs Virtual Machine

A Virtual Machine runs a full-blown operating system while a Docker container runs natively and shares the host kernel. A Docker container is light-weight whereas a Virtual Machine has much more overhead in terms of system resources. A Docker container runs as a separate process.
